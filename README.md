# Speech-to-Text Chat Bot

## Overview

The Speech-to-Text Chat Bot is a Python-based project that allows users to interact with a chat bot using their voice. The chat bot can recognize spoken words, convert them into text, and respond to user queries and commands.

This project uses the SpeechRecognition library for voice recognition and the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech synthesis. It provides an interactive interface where users can have a conversation with the chat bot.

## Features

- Voice recognition: The chat bot can understand and interpret spoken words using Google's speech recognition technology.

- Natural language understanding: The bot uses a natural language processing (NLP) model to understand user intents and respond accordingly.

- Text-to-speech synthesis: The bot can articulate responses audibly, providing a conversational experience.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required libraries and dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install speech_recognition pyttsx3
